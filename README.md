# RE-RASSOR-light
### my re-design of the rerassor to be smaller
A few years back, I made a project taking the base of https://github.com/colemaring/RE-RASSOR-lightweight and expanding upon it.
<br>What I did was to shrink the robot by re-designing the CAD
<br>see the cad at https://cad.onshape.com/documents/527fa87ff43826b74ba00052/w/54a235068f3846898c9498cf/e/9dbbef92915a55ac51c82182?renderMode=0&uiState=694c15a296d4aa6277bf4b21<br>
The only electrical change was that I used 2520 fans.
